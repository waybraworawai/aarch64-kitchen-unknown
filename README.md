# Kitchen Architecture Project

### Introduction

In the design of my kitchen architecture, every attempt was made to make the resource allocations within the kitchen environment as generic as possible. One resource boundary that we had to introduce at a physical layer is the cleanliness of the internal implementations of the resource queues themselves, in order to respect the purity of certain dietary restrictions. Therefore, we decided to implement this delineation through separation of the architecture target. This decision allows the architecture to be customized in a very detailed way that might be problematic through virtualization.

### Target Architectures

#### any-kitchen-unknown

A very generic kitchen architecture, allowing the creation of all food.

### Usage Examples

- **any-kitchen-unknown**: Suitable for general kitchens where no specific dietary laws need to be enforced. Ideal for standard commercial and residential kitchens.
